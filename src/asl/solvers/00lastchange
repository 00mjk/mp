  asl.h, obj_adj.c, qp_read.c:  fix a bug (possible fault under some
conditions) in some solver interfaces that call qp_read() and allow
objective modifications on problems with quadratic constraints and
linear objectives.  The entire library should be recompiled.
  mqpcheckv.c, nqpcheck.c, nqpcheckZ.c:  for the benefit of interfaces
to cplex, gurobi, and xpress, use Cgrad rather than asl->i.Cgrad0,
which matters when there are objective modifications.
