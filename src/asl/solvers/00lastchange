  dtoa.c (and dtoa1.c):  Fix glitches with floating-point values in
hexadecimal notation (use of which is supported but very unlikely):
some values that should overflow to (appropriately signed) Infinity,
such as 0x1p1025, were mishandled, and values greater than 0x1p-1075
and less than 0x1.0000000000001p-1075 where treated as zero rather
than the smallest denormal number.  AMPL does not use hexadecimal
notation for floating-point numbers in .nl files, so solvers should
not be affected.
