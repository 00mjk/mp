  readsol.c:  new variant fread_sol_ASL of read_sol_ASL with signature

  char* fread_sol_ASL(ASL*, const char *fname, real**xp, real **yp);

which adds argument fname to specify the full name of the ".sol" file
to read.  (This name need not end in ".sol".)  This is used in today's
updated solvers/examples/et.c, via a corresponding new #define of
fread_sol() in asl.h.
