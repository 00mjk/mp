  fg_read.c, fgh_read.c, pfg_read.c, pfghread.c:  recant most of the
changes of 20150208; the "nvinc" logic had made them unnecessary.
One change retained:  if the incoming X0 or havex0 (i.e., asl->i.X0_
or asl->i.havex0_) are nonzero, only the first n_var components are
zeroed initially, rather than the first
n_var + asl->i.nsufext[ASL_Sufkind_var] components.
