  degree.c:  fix a bug handling linear defined variables used linearly:
degree() could return 0 rather than 1 if nothing else contributed to
the objective or constraint being assessed.
  con1ival.c, con2ival.c, dtoa.c, dtoa1.c, ind_cons.c mqpcheckv.c,
nqpcheck.c:  tweaks for C++ compilation.
  xectim.c:  adjust to use clock_gettime() unless compiled with
-DNO_CLOCK_GETTIME or -DNO_RUSAGE.
