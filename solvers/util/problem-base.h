/*
 Base types and functions related to the optimization problem.

 This header is used to decouple the .nl reader from a specific problem
 representation as the reader can be used to construct different types of
 problems. So instead of including problem.h and expr.h from nl.h, this
 header containing common stuff is included from problem.h, expr.h and nl.h.
